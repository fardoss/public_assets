# Delimiters

You can set your custom delimiters in your dashboard.

After uploading your custom images, on the right side nav, under the Advanced tab, you will find the settings needed to update your delimiter.

So for example:

- If my custom delimiter is @, then the file name will be
  
  - blue moon@blue glow@grey and blue samurai robe@NA@Black and Blue Samurai@NA@NA@Blue Orb@NA.jpeg

Keep in mind that you must include all trait values even if they are not included in your file name.
