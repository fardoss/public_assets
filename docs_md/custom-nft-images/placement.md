We offer 3 types of custom image placements.

1. In Order

2. Randomly

3. Custom

#### In Order

The default custom image placement is in order. When we are generating your collection, we add all your custom images to the end of the collection.

#### Randomly

This randomizes the placement of every custom image within your collection. So if we want the collection size to be 10 + 40 custom images, we randomly choose different spots between 0 and 49. 

#### Custom

Specify where different custom images should be placed within your collection.

This is great if you want to create sweepstakes or giveaways when someone randomly chooses an NFT.
