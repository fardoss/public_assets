We offer 3 types of custom image placements:

1. In Order

2. Randomly

3. Custom

#### In Order

The default custom image placement is in order. When we are generating your collection, we add all your custom images to the end of the collection.

#### Randomly

This randomizes the placement of every custom image within your collection. So if you want to generate 10 NFT's and upload 40 custom NFT's, we randomly choose different spots between 0 and 49. 

#### Custom

Specify where different your custom NFT's should be placed within your collection.

This is great if you want to create sweepstakes or giveaways when someone randomly buys an NFT.
