# Threads

Threads can be configured on the right side nav. Setting the number of threads always Fardoss to know how many NFT's it should be creating at the same time.

Depending on your computer, threads will try it's best to create the best NFT's in the shortest amount of time.

For example, if you set the threads to 10, Fardoss will (depending on your computer) generate 10 images at the same time.

On average, Fardoss can generate 4 images every 2 seconds. 

- To generate 1,000 images, it will take about 8 minutes.
  
  - We believe the quality of NFT's are much more valuable than how fast it should be generating.
