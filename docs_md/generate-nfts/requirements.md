# Requirements

Fardoss needs to understand which trait folders must be included within your collection. If you set a trait folder **required**, at least one of images within that trait folder will be included in every single NFT.

After you upload your assets, you can set the requirements on the left side nav. The check box next to "Clear all" will set every trait folder required.

In this example, everything is required except dynasty and clothes. Every NFT will have all the required assets but only some of them will have the trait dynasty or clothes.

This helps you create rare NFT's as well as improve the overall quality of each NFT.
