# Generated GIFs

GIFs is an incredible resource that can help your NFT collection shine on sites like Opensea. 

After Fardoss generates your NFT collection, It automatically takes the first 10 images in your collection and creates a GIF that you can use in your marketing. You can find your GIF in the asset_generator folder.
