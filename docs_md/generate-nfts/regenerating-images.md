# Regenerating Images

We understand that sometimes mistakes happen. Which is why we created this awesome feature called **Regenerate**. 

This incredible widget allows you to fix any NFT within your collection without having to recreate the entire collection.

#### How to use:

In the Image Viewer, scroll through all the created NFT's. Choose the NFT you want to regenerate.

![Regenerate NFT](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.fardoss.com/docs_content/Regenerate-image.png)

On the top right, you will find a button called "Regenerate Image'". This will create a dropdown with all the traits in that image. Click the (x) button to remove the trait and then tap Regenerate.

Fardoss will regenerate that single NFT with the updated layers.
