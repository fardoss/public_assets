IF remove offers 3 options:

1. Starts with

2. Ends with

Add multiple If rows and then choose the one you want to remove in the Then section.

You can also add folders and Fardoss will automatically know if that trait is in that folder or not.

#### For example:

We have 3 points:

1. If an image ends with viking

2. AND a folder name starts with background

3. AND a folder name includes eyes

If these 3 points are met, Fardoss will remove

1. Folder that starts with background
