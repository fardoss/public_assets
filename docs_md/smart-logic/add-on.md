# Add on

If an asset requires an add-on, Fardoss will randomly choose from the THEN row and automatically add another trait to your image.

This is mostly used for NFT's that require reusability in layers.

#### For example:

If the folder "Hands", need to have 5 sleeves from the same folder "Sleeves", you would create an add-on and Fardoss will randomly choose from the folder "Sleeves", a sleeve even if there already exists a sleeve.

That's right! Reusable asset images are finally here!
