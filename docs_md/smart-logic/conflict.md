# Conflict

Conflicts allow you to remove specific assets from a trait set if they conflict with each other.

#### For example:

Lets say that we have a trait folder called Eyes. These eyes are required for all NFT's but if a body is Monk, some eyes won't fit correctly with that body. 

The best decision is to remove the eyes completely if they the body has a specific image.  (ie: Some eyes conflict with Body Monk)



#### To do this:

In the IF section, we add all the bodies that are Asian. In this case, we only have one: Monk.png

*You can also add other bodies by click the Add row or just by using the image picker.*

Then we need to remove any eyes that don't work with the body Monk.

#### Final Result:

When we are generating your NFT's, Fardoss looks for any conflict (ie: Body Monks) with the conflicting image (ie: Red Glow.png) etc.

If a conflict is found, it is removed from the trait set completely.
