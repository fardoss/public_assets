# Smart Logic

Smart Logic is an incredible widget that allows you to add complex if statements to your collection.  Smart logic runs after the traits have been determined for each image but before the image is created.

Smart Logic is located on the right side nav under the "Advanced" tab.

We offer 6 widgets to help you get the most of your collection:

#### For Example:

Let's say that your assets include different body colors like

1. Dark

2. Asian

3. Viking

4. Alien

Now let's also say that your assets include hands for each of these bodies. 

- The first conflict we see is that a Dark Body CANNOT have an asian hand. This will basically ruin the NFT. 

To mitigate this conflict, we created Smart Logic. Using a basic if statement system, you can create the perfect NFT with unlimited potential. 

#### Features

Each IF statement module allows you to select multiple images or single directories. This makes it easier for you to select multiple trait categories.
