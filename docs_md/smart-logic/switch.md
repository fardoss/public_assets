# Switch

Switch statements allow you to switch out specific traits within your collection.

The purpose for this is to give you more control over the rarity of your NFTs. If your NFT collection is constantly using the same background over and over, you might want to switch that background on some of your NFT's with something different.

#### For example:

If a fiery fog background is included or dark grey, deep orange or grey images are included, then Fardoss will randomly switch with another image or folder. In this case, it is the Background Folder.
