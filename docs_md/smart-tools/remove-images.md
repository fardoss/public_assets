# Remove Images

If you want to quickly remove images from your collection that you don't like, you can use this tool to remove and automatically fix the file names (ie: 0,1,2,3,4).

#### Features

- You can search through your entire collection or even filter just for your custom images. 

- You can also hover over each image icon and it will show you what that image looks like

When we remove images, we also remove the JSON data for it and clean up the file names so that they are consistent with your entire collection.
