# Merge

Sometimes you might want to generate different collections from the same asset folders.

To get the collection ready, you will have to merge all of them together into one finished collection.

Merge allows to to merge multiple collections together. All the images and json from one folder will be added.

#### File structure

All the folders MUST include an images and json folder and the NFT's and json MUST be connected correctly.

#### Merged assets

Your merged assets will all be copied to the output location you entered starting with 0. 

#### Quick Tips:

- We do not move or remove any of the images or json in your collection folders you want to merge.
  
  - We just copy the file to the new location and change the name and json data to fit the final collection ouput.

- Your json data will also update with the correct image and your traits will be synced from each of your asset folders to their new file names.
