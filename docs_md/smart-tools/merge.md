# Merge

Sometimes you might want to generate different versions of your NFT and choose the best ones from each. 

Now that you have chosen all the NFT's you want, you still have to get them ready for production.

#### Merged assets

Your merged assets will all be copied to the output location you entered starting with 0. 

#### Quick Tips:

- We do not move or remove any of the images or json in your collection folders you want to merge.
  
  - We just copy the file to the new location and change the name and json data to fit the final collection

- Your json data will also update with the correct image and your traits will be synced from each of your asset folders to their new file names.
