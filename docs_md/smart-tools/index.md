- Remove Traits

- Change Trait Values

- Remove images

- Change Metadata Type

- Adding custom images

#### Features

After you have successfully generated your collection, you might want to do different things to alter what you created. Sometimes you want to rename your NFT's and JSON, merge multiple generated collections together or even add custom traits to your collection metadata.

You can easily do these things with this awesome tool.

Smart Tools can be found on the top right of your dashboard.

#### Quick Tips:

- When you want to specify an output location, make sure that there are 2 folders:
  
  - Images
  
  - json

- If you are just testing and you don't want to lose the results from the main generation, make sure to make a copy of the assets_generator folder somewhere else since we will alter it.
