Fardoss offers the follow options:

1. Add text to the beginning

2. Add text to the end

3. Remove text

4. Set start number

#### Add text to the beginning

When you set the value of what you want your filename to start with, we automatically change the file names of all your images and json. 

So if we set the beginning of the file name to be "Fardoss_", then the images and JSON will look something like this:

#### Adding text to the end

This does exactly what adding text to the beginning but it adds to the end instead

#### Remove text

If you want to remove a specific phrase within your image/json file names, you can easily do this with this feature.

#### Set start number

By default, Fardoss automatically starts your images and json with 0. You can change that to any number you want. So if we start the number to 30, it will rename all the images and json from 30, 31, 32, 33 etc.

#### Quick Tips:

- When you change the file names, we automatically change the name field in your metadata. This allows you to keep the same structure as well if you choose to [upload to Pinata](https://fardoss.com/docs/generate-nfts/uploading-to-pinata).
