# Setting up a collection

Fardoss recognizes a specific assets folder format. The reason for this is because it makes it much easier for you to set up layer rarities and placements for each collection.

#### Organizing your assets

Your trait folders like Background, Eyes, Face Mask, etc must be the first folders within your assets like so:

The numbers in the beginning of each trait folder determine the placement of how each trait will be layered to create your images.

The trait names ie: 1. Background are used to create the attributes within your metadata. Don't worry, we remove all numbers automatically so your traits within your metadata stay super clean.
