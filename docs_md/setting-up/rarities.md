# Rarities

Rarities are one of the most important aspects of an NFT. This allows sites like Opensea to rate how rare your NFT is. 

Within Fardoss, rarities are configured within your traits folder as sub folders.

This tells Fardoss how likely the images within the rarity folder should be included in your collection.

#### Setting up percentages

Once you add your assets to Fardoss, click the Rarity tab on the right side nav.

In our example, Background has the following rarity folders

- Normal

- Rare

- Legendary

- Super Rare

- Ultra Rare

- Double Ultra Rare

*Make sure that the names in your folder match the right side nav.*

Next, we set the percentage of how likely the images within each folder will be included within the collection. 

In our example, Super Rare is 10 percent. This means that within our collection, 10 percent or less of the entire collection will have a Background Super Rare image. This goes for all your trait folders (ie: Background, Mask, Face)
