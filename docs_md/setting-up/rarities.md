# Rarities

Rarities are one of the most important aspects of an NFT. This allows for sites like Opensea to rate how rare an NFT is. 

Within Fardoss, rarities are configured within your traits folder.

Rarity folders are sub folders within your trait folder. This tells Fardoss how likely the images within the rarity folder should be included in your collection.

#### Setting up percentages

Once you add your assets to Fardoss, click the Rarity tab on the right side nav.

In our example, Background has the following rarity folders

- Normal

- Rare

- Legendary

- Super Rare

- Ultra Rare

- Double Ultra Rare

Make sure that the names in your folder match the right side nav.

Next, we set the percentage of how likely the images within each folder should be included within the collection. 

In our example, Super Rare is 10 percent. This means that within our collection, 10 percent or less of the entire collection will have a Background Super Rare image.
