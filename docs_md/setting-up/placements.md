# Placements

To understand how to create your images, we need to understand the order that each trait must be added. 

#### For example:

If we have a Background, Face and Face Mask image, we have to layer these correctly so the image is perfect.

We use numbers within the trait folders to do this.

Because Background starts with 1.  , Fardoss will know that this image must be placed in the beginning. Then Eyes will be placed because it is #2 and so on.

The format that each trait folder should have is as follows.

- The number (ie: 1,2,3,4,5) - to determine trait order

- One period

- One space

- Then the name of the trait

Fardoss also allows you to manually configure the placement. On the right side, you will find a tab called Placement.

Once you upload your assets, we will first check to see if you set the order in your trait folders. If not, you can easily set the placement for each trait folder included.
